# CS Resources
## My final project for my college web development course

This website was written using only HTML and CSS. There is no Javascript or front-end frameworks being used. 

This project was meant to demonstrate key concepts in HTML/CSS:

**HTML**
- Forms and input fields
- Semantic elements
- Tables
- Images
- Lists
- Meta tags

**CSS**
- Coloring
- Fonts, including Google Fonts
- CSS class and id's
- Image styling
- The box model (padding, border, margin)
- Flex and grid display modes
- Media queries
- Pseudo-classes
